## Project Overview

The **Sistema Gestion Apartamentos (SGA)** is a software solution programmed entirely in **C** designed to manage the rental process of buildings with multiple types of apartments. The system facilitates the management and booking of apartments for various periods, ensuring smooth operations in the rental process.

### Features:

1. **Building Management**:
   The system supports multiple buildings, each with a set of apartments. These apartments come in three different categories:

   - **Basic**: Basic, no-frills apartments suitable for budget-conscious renters.
   - **Standard**: Regular apartments with typical amenities.
   - **Luxury**: High-end apartments with premium features and amenities.

2. **Booking Management**:
   The system allows users to book apartments for specified dates in the upcoming months. It ensures that no overlapping bookings occur by checking for previous reservations and preventing conflicts.

3. **Reservation Validation**:
   A key feature of the system is the ability to verify that there are no existing reservations for the selected dates. If the dates are already booked, the system will notify the user and provide alternative options.

4. **User Interface**:
   The system offers a simple and intuitive **command-line interface (CLI)** that allows users to easily navigate through available apartments, view their details, and select their desired rental dates. The interface is text-based and operates entirely within the terminal, providing an efficient and straightforward user experience.

5. **General Functionality**:
   Much like popular booking apps (e.g., Booking.com), the system mimics the core functionality of apartment rental, allowing users to:
   - Browse available apartments.
   - Make reservations.
   - Confirm booking availability.
   - View and manage past bookings.

This project is ideal for understanding the core functionality of a rental system, simulating real-world scenarios and user interactions in apartment bookings.

## Technologies Used

- **C Programming Language**: The entire project is developed using the C language, making it suitable for those who wish to understand low-level programming concepts.
